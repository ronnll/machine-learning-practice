Write a Python program for optimizing the SVM hinge loss using 
gradient descent algorithm. The input and output should be the same as for
assignment 2.

Test your program with the input data

1 1
1 2
1 3
3 1
3 2
3 3
50 2

and labels 

0 0
0 1
0 2
1 3
1 4
1 5
1 6

Convert label 0 to -1 so that labels yi are either +1 or -1. This is
necessary for the gradient descent to work.

Use eta=.001 and stopping condition of while(abs(prevobj - obj) > .000000001). 
Note the absolute value to account for instability in the gradient for hinge 
loss. The converged solution with the hinge loss would be approximately

w = (1.4605574252399243, -0.4595542036671061)
w0 = -2.0024682128830427
Dist to origin= 1.3078203832146862

Submit your assignment by copying it into the directory
/afs/cad/courses/ccs/f18/cs/675/101/<ucid>.
For example if your ucid is abc12 then copy your solution into 
/afs/cad/courses/ccs/f18/cs/675/101/abc12.

Your completed script is due Oct 10 2018
