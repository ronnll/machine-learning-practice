# Machine-Learning
Naive_Bayes: Implement the Naive Bayes classifier in Python. The input should be a dataset file and a set of training labels. The output should produce predicted labels for the test dataset which are feature vectors whose labels are not given for training.
Least_Squares: Least squares model and single perceptron implementations
Hinge_Loss: Implementation of linear classifier that optimizes hinge loss
