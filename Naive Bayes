Write a Python program that implements the Naive Bayes classifier.Your program should take as input a dataset file and a set of
training labels in the format given in the example datasets on the course website.As output your program should produce 
predicted labels for the test dataset which are feature vectors whose labels are not given for training. 

Submit your assignment by copying it into the directory /afs/cad/courses/ccs/f18/cs/675/101/<ucid>. For example if your ucid 
is abc12 then copy your solution into /afs/cad/courses/ccs/f18/cs/675/101/abc12.
